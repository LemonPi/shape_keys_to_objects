# Shape Keys to Objects

Turn an object's shape keys into cloned objects, optionally with modifiers and vertex groups removed.
The clones are named `<name>_<shape key>` and their data are named `<name>_<shape key>Shape`

## Usage

With an object selected, press `F3` and choose `Create duplicated objects for each shape key`.

## Installation

Select "File -> User Preferences" and choose "Addon" tab. Click "Install from file..." 
and choose the downloaded file (only "shape_keys_to_objects.py", not the folder).

For Blender 2.9 make sure "Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Developer Extras" is checked. Blender 2.91.2 onward does not require this step.
